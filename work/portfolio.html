			Currently, you are looking at the third iteration of my portfolio.

		<div class = "subtitle">Version 1</div>
		<div class = "text">During this version, I spent a lot of time defining what I wanted to accomplish through my online portfolio - showcasing both my work and my personality. Though my final product was less than stellar, I was incredibly proud of myself for finishing this on my own. This iteration took about two weeks to finish.</div><br>

		<div class = "subtitle">Version 2</div>
		<div class = "text">Upon completing the V1 of my portfolio, I felt that I hadn't completely conveyed what I had set out to in V1. Admittedly, I got nervous looking at other designers' portfolios, noting that their portfolio works looked cleaner and more "them". Accordingly, I set out to make my portfolio to showcase myself a little more. I completed a set of mockups and even asked my roommate to take some nice, designer-y photos of myself. I completed this iteration in about a week, as I had a better understanding of file heirarchy and versatile code.</div><br>

		<div class = "subtitle">Version 3</div>
		<div class = "text">I finished V2 near the end of my fall 2015 semester. Upon completing it, I was incredibly proud and excited to have finished. I posted it on Facebook, reached out to fellow designers, and sought out feedback. I gained a lot of good notes and was excited to make those changes over winter break. However, once break hit, I realized that I had spent too much time focusing on trying to showcasing myself, which is important, but I didn't spend enough time showing my work. Though I'm embarrassed to admit it, it took me some time to realize that being a product designer is not solely about having a flashy portfolio rather it's about showing who you are and what you can do through your work. And at the end of the day, the flashy portfolio wasn't me.</div><br>
