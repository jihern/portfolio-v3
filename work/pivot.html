			This past semester (September to December 2015), I was involved in <a class = "link" href = "https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyinnovation" target = "_about">Berkeley Innovation</a> (BI), Cal's Human-Centered Design Organization. Through BI, I was placed into a team of four and assigned to work with <a class = "link" href = "https://www.vertigo.com" target = "_blank">Vertigo Software</a> (recently acquired by <a class = "link" href = "http://www.mlbam.com" target = "_about">MLBAM</a>). <b>My team and I designed and prototyped a version control system for designers, utilizing concepts from Git and transforming said concepts into designer-friendly features.</b> My personal contributions included conducting competitor analyses; working on ideation; and designing the feed, project views and interactions, the user view, the collaboration feature, and the app map, through all fidelity mockups.
