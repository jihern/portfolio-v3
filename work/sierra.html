			On November 7th, 2015, I participated in CMYK, an annual designathon hosted by <a class = "link" href = "http://innovativedesign.club">Innovative Design</a> (I was also on the Web Development Tier)! My group and I worked for about 4 hours to develop a marketing campaign on behalf of this year's client, Sierra Nevada - the campaign targeting the Baby Boomer generation (60+). My specific contributions included introducing the initial concept, further developing it into a visual idea, giving input with the physical designs, and designing the final drink cards.

		<div class = "subtitle">Prompt</div>
		<div class = "text">We were asked to choose from three prompts. We decided on the following: <i>Studies have shown that as baby boomers enter their old age, there is a growing demand for Sierra Nevada's products from the elderly population (60+). While the products will remain the same, your team is commissioned to produce a new branding campaign that best targets and caters to the needs and wants of this demographic.</i>

		<div class = "subtitle">Disclaimer</div>
		<div class = "text">I felt it was important to include a short disclaimer regarding our campaign. My team was cognizant that some of the events we selected were controversial, as they were heavily impacted by western/white-centric policies. Naturally, we are not in agreement with much of the additional burden that was placed on already marginalized communities during that time. We do believe in celebrating and honoring the Baby Boomer generation and our nation's history with the acknowledgment that many events that occurred whilst were, in fact, dishonorable. We hope that that sentiment is accepted by recipients of our project.
