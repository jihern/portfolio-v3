			Hi, my name is <b>Ji-hern Baek</b>, and I'm passionate about people. I want to learn everything I can about others - their idiosyncrasies, their stories. In doing so, I learn a lot about myself, too.<br><br>
			I am a <b>Product Designer</b>, finding joy in the intersection between people, design, and technology. Currently, I work as a Visual Design Intern for a marketing consulting firm and recently helped out with the two following projects: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ember-temperature-adjustable-mug#/" target="_blank">Ember</a> and <a href="https://shop.leeo.com/" target="_blank">Leeo</a>. Over the summer, I balanced my time as a UX Design Intern at a VR startup called <a href="http://www.fulldive.com" target= "_blank">FullDive</a> and as a Styling & Marketing Intern at <a href="https://trueandco.com/" target="_blank">True&Co.</a>, a lingerie e-commerce startup.<br><br>
			I am also a fourth year at <b>UC Berkeley</b>, majoring in Cognitive Science (with a concentration in Society, Culture, and Cognition) and minoring in Computer Science. In addition to academics, I served as the president of the Korean American Student Association; was involved in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtistsInResonance" target="_blank">a cappella group</a>; was a part of <a href="http://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyinnovation/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a> - two of Cal's design organizations; and currently work in our university's <a href="https://asuc.org/" target="_blank">student government</a>.
